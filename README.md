**Predictive Modeling Project Overview**

This repository contains the code and documentation for a predictive modeling project aimed at comparing the performance of three different machine learning algorithms on a specific dataset. The primary goal was to identify which model yields the highest accuracy in predicting the target variable.

**Models Evaluated**

The following machine learning models were evaluated in this project:

**Random Forest Classifier:** A ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.

**XGBoost:** A highly efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting framework.

**K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN):** A simple, instance-based learning algorithm where the prediction for a new instance is based on the most similar past instances.
**Data Preprocessing**
The dataset underwent a series of cleaning and modification processes to improve model performance. Key steps included:

**Handling Missing Values:** Missing data points were carefully handled either by imputation or removal, depending on their impact on the dataset.

**Feature Engineering:** New features were created, and irrelevant features were removed to enhance the models' predictive power.

**Normalization:** Feature scaling was applied to normalize the data, ensuring that models that rely on distance calculations could perform optimally.

**Results**

The initial accuracy scores obtained from each model were as follows:

**Random Forest Classifier:** 62.5%

**XGBoost:** 52.1%

**K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN):** 48.7%

After refining the data and employing crosstab for accuracy calculation, the models' performance improved significantly, yielding a maximum accuracy of 67.5%.

**Conclusion**

The project demonstrates the importance of thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering in predictive modeling. The improvement in model accuracy following data modification underscores the potential for even basic techniques, like crosstab, to provide insightful performance metrics. The Random Forest Classifier emerged as the most effective model before data modification, but with enhanced data preprocessing, a more nuanced evaluation revealed overall best performance, surpassing all individual models tested initially.
